# comma operations challenge

[comma 3X](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x) supports more than 300 different car models from every major brand.
The [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/harness-connector) is our car-specific part that canonicalizes all the different
car connectors into the "OBD-C" port that plugs into the comma 3X.

Currently, we stock [43 different harness connectors](https://github.com/commaai/hardware/tree/master/harness), and we expect the number
of different harness connectors to continue to grow with the compatibility list.

Our harness connectors are currently produced by a wire harness manufacturer in
200-500 quantity, and we sell them for a decent margin.

Your goal is to come up with a brief plan to bring harness connector manufacturing capabilities in-house to the [comma factory](https://youtu.be/PFjssb7r_uU).
