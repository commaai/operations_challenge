# comma operations challenge

[comma 3X](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x) supports 300 different car models.
The [car harness](https://github.com/commaai/hardware/tree/master/harness) adapts the different connectors in those cars to our standard "OBD-C" port that plugs into the comma 3X.

Currently, we stock [43 different harness connectors](https://comma.ai/shop/harness-connector), and we expect the number
of different harness connectors to continue growing with car compatibility.

Our harness connectors are currently produced by a wire harness manufacturer in
batches of 500 quantity per-connector, and we sell them for a decent margin.

Your goal is to assess the feasibility of bringing harness connector manufacturing in-house to the [comma factory](https://youtu.be/PFjssb7r_uU).
